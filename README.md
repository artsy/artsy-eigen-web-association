# artsy-eigen-web-association

This tiny app does nothing but serve the `apple-app-site-association` file,
needed for iOS Handoff/Universal Links/Shared Web Credentials to work, in the
required way.

For more information see:

- [Handoff programming guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/Handoff/AdoptingHandoff/AdoptingHandoff.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014338-CH2-SW10)

## Serving config file

This app is meant to be used inside other apps. As such, the file serving is
mounted at `/`, which means that the apps using this app should mount it at
`/apple-app-site-association`.

Once mounted, you should be able to verify itâ€™s correctness [here](https://branch.io/resources/aasa-validator/).

## Changing config file

When making changes, you should do so in the `apple-app-site-association.json` file.

## After config changes are merged

After changes to the `apple-app-site-association.json` file have been merged, you'll need to update the three places that depend on it which include force and artsy-wwwify. To update the package in force and artsy-wwwify run the command `yarn add @artsy/artsy-eigen-web-association@latest` in those repositories and check that in. See [This PR](https://github.com/artsy/artsy-eigen-web-association/pull/40) as an example

## Caching

Apple caches the apple-app-site-association file on app install. If you're having trouble clearing the apple-app-site-association file cache on your device, try updating the app or turn Universal Linking [off (and on again)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32729489/how-can-i-reset-ios-9-universal-linking-settings). While it's not known how often the cache is updated, it does appear to periodically between installs and updates. More details about how Apple caches this file can be found on this [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41305871).
